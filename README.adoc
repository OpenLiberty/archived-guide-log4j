= Deploying applications to Open Application Server Liberty with Log4j support
Frank Ji <frankji@ca.ibm.com>

== What you will Learn
You will be introduced to the popular Apache logging framework Log4j, and learn how to add logs to your Open Liberty applications using Log4j. At the end of this guide, you will know how to add Log4j to your Open Liberty application, writing log statement and configuring the Log4j configuration file for advanced logging formats and rules.

=== Why use Log4j when there is Java Logging API
The java.util.logging or more commonly known as the java logging API serves as a very capable logging framework for many. However, the Java logging API lacks the flexibility for developers to define customized logging output options such as format and log files on demand. The developers would often need to implement some new Formatter and LogHandler codes should the logging requirement changed. Changing production code can be both time consuming and many times, not a practical solution.This part is where Log4j comes into play. Not only it’s a feature-packed logging framework; the ability to change one’s logging output on demand is where it truly shines. Before going into all the great things about Log4j, there are couple caveats of using Log4j with Open Liberty that should be noted by the readers. Open Liberty does not control the log levels of Log4j Loggers in the server.xml file, it also doesn’t consume log entries, and thus it won't output the logs to the default messages.log when Log4j is used instead of java logging. The logging level and output options are solely configured through Log4j config file which will be discussed in the later sections. That being said, Log4j is a powerful framework that should be worth looking for advanced logging when developing Liberty applications.

== Getting started
The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the git repository and use the starting project that is provided in the start directory. To do this run the following command:
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/log4jSample.git
cd log4jSample/start
----

== Adding Log4j Loggers to a Liberty Application
The following instruction describes the typical steps involved in using Log4j loggers in a Liberty Application. 
In the IDE of choice or an editor of your choice, open the pom.xml file, which is at the root of the project.
Add the Log4j dependency to the <dependencies> section of the pom.xml file.

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.9.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
        <version>2.9.1</version>
</dependency>
----

In the HelloServlets class, get a logger instance. Log4j loggers are always acquired by calling the LogManager.getLogger() instead of creating a new Logger object. One thing to note is that the LogManager and Logger class referred in the code is from package org.apache.logging.log4j, not the java.util.logging.

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(LibertyServlet.class.getName());
----

The actual use of Log4j Logger object is a lot like the java logging Logger, just log with the message string and the log level. 

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
LOGGER.info("hello liberty servlet info message!");
LOGGER.debug("hello liberty servlet debug message!");
LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "hello liberty servlet warning message!");
----

For the most part, that's all there needs to be done code wise to start developing an application using Log4j as the framework. For the people who are serious about their application logs, like writing log to a database instead of files, or having custom output format for their log entries, the good news is that all this can be done in the Log4j config file without changing the existing application code.

== Build the log4j config file
The next step in the configuration is to set up the Log4j configuration file. In Log4j 2.x, the config file can be prepared in one of the following formats: properties file, JSON, YAML, and XML.  You can use whichever format you are most comfortable with as each format will get the job done. My personal preference is the XML format as it's one of the more popular choices among the developer community.

While there are a lot of things you can work with the Log4j config file, the primary usages for the config file are to configure two things: 1. loggers and 2. appenders. Logger configuration would allow the user to config the logging level for each of the loggers defined and specifying the appenders to be used for each logger. In the meantime, the appender configuration gives the user the control to define the output location and the output format of their log files. Log4j provides a couple dozens of predefined Appender classes for users to work with, which saves the user from developing its own mechanism to output to different locations and formats. The packaged appenders range from basic ones such as Console or File appenders to the more specific JDBC or Kafka appenders that will satisfy majority of the projects' logging needs. 

In this example, we'll be creating a file appender and a console appender. The file appender will be rolling over on a daily basis, and will be writing to the file in a custom format we specified in our log4j2.xml file. The console appender will be outputting the Log4j JSON formatted message to stdout. In the logger configuration, we will be redirecting all the debug level logs from the LibertyServlet to our Daily rolling file appender and all the info level logs to the console appender. Also, remember what we mentioned previously in the introduction, a user can only specify log level for different loggers either using the Log4j config file or programmatically in the code. They will not be able to set up log levels in the Liberty server's server.xml as they would for the default java logging loggers.

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<Configuration>
  <Properties>
           <Property name="log-path">logs</Property>
  </Properties>
  
  <Appenders>
    <RollingFile name="DailyRolling" fileName="${log-path}/myexample.log" append="true"
    filePattern="${log-path}/myexample-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}-%i.log">
      <PatternLayout>
              <pattern>%d{ISO8601} %-5p [%c] %x &lt;%t&gt; - %m%n</pattern>
      </PatternLayout>
      <Policies>
              <TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy interval="1" modulate="true"/>
      </Policies>
    </RollingFile>
    <Console name="STDOUT" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
        <JsonLayout/>
    </Console>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Logger name="application.servlet.LibertyServlet" level="debug">
      <AppenderRef ref="DailyRolling"/>
    </Logger>
    <Root level="debug">
      <AppenderRef ref="STDOUT"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

When writing Log4j config files, be mindful when using Log4j provided classes. Some of this classes will require additional dependencies during runtime, and will not be caught when compiling the maven project. In this example, JsonLayout used for Console logging would need classes from com.fasterxml.jackson.core during runtime. Failing to include the Jackson package would result in the following error when visiting the servlet:

"Error 404: javax.servlet.UnavailableException: SRVE0203E: Servlet [application.servlet.LibertyServlet]: application.servlet.LibertyServlet was found but is missing another required class. SRVE0206E: This error typically implies that the servlet was originally compiled with classes which cannot be located by the server. SRVE0187E: Check your classpath to ensure that all classes required by the servlet are present.SRVE0210I: This problem can be debugged by recompiling the servlet using only the classes in the application's runtime classpath SRVE0234I: Application class path=[com.ibm.ws.classloading.internal.ThreadContextClassLoader@400b9abe] "

We'll need to add the dependency in our pom.xml file like so:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>
----

It is always good practcie to read Log4j documents before including any Log4j classes in the configuration file to find out if there are any external library dependencies for these classes.

== Add Log4j config file to classpath
Once the config file is all completed, the only step remaining is adding the config file to the runtime classpath. This step is where I have seen most mistakes made by developers and is partially the reason that inspired me to write a blog on this topic to help future developers out of the mystery of not seeing their logs.

=== Option 1: Package with the application
The most straightforward way of doing this task is simply adding the file to your application's CLASSPATH and packaging the file in your application's war file. By default, that should be under the 'src/main/resources' directory of your maven application.  This is a good way for placing the Log4j config file if one just wants to a write the configuration file once, package it and call for the day.

Often times, developers find the needs to modify the log configuration from time to time. Whether it is to change the logging levels or to change the format of the log output, it will be a lot of work to re-package the application and having the new application re-deployed to the server. It can be a lot more convenient if the server is able to pick up any changes in the Log4j configuration file from the file system automatically after a server restart. There are three approaches we could use to achieve this.

=== Option 2: Configure in the server.xml
The second approach is to config comonLibraryRef using server.xml file of an Open Liberty Server. A user can specify a directory that has the log4j config file stored, and config the server to pick up files stored in that directory during class loading time.

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
 ...
     <library id="log4jConfig">
            <folder dir="/{directory containning log4j config file}" scanInterval="5s" />
     </library>
     <webApplication id="sample.servlet" location="sample.servlet.war" name="sample.servlet"/>
            <classloader commonLibraryRef="log4jConfig"/>
     </webApplication>
 ...
----

=== Option 3: Copy to the global shared library folder
If you don't feel like modifying the configuration of you serverl.xml, you can simply copy the log4j config file to the Liberty's default server scope/global scope shared library directory. They are located at the following locations:
----
${shared.config.dir}/lib/global
${server.config.dir}/lib/global
----

=== Option 4: Set as a JVM argument
The final approach is to set the log4j configuration via server's JVM arguments. To do this, simply add the following line to the jvm.options file of your Liberty server's directory:
----
-Dlog4j.configurationFile=file:/path/to/log4j2.xml
----
Once the server is restarted, the Log4j config file specified in the directory will be picked up by the server.

It's possible that a user might have configured the Log4j config file using more than one of the aforementioned ways. Then there will arise the issue where some method will be overriding the other methods. There are no official Log4j documentation or Liberty documentation on how it should behave. My personal tests showed that the jvm.options is able to override all the other configurations. Configuration done in server.xml will be overriding the Log4j config files placed in global libraries directory. What's interesting is that the Log4j config file packaged in the application's war file can override the ones set in server.xml, in the meantime, it can be overwritten by Log4j config files in either of the global shared libraries. So the there is not a commutative overriding rule of having multiple Log4j config files in place. The rules can be best summarized in the diagram below.

== Great work! You are done!
Congratulations, you've just built an Open Liberty application with a robust Log4j setup. Once you start the Liberty server instance, you should be able to view all your application logs being served just the way you like it.
